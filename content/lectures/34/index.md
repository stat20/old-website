Oftentimes, we want to use linear models to predict an outcome variable with not one, but two (or more) variables! This leads us to perform an extension of the simple linear model/regression known as multiple linear regression. As with the simple case, we can perform inference and model checks. We also can measure the interplay, or interaction between our two (or more) predictive variables.

## Key Questions

- How can we construct confidence intervals for each parameter in our linear model?
- Can we identify the population for which we want to draw inference on for a given linear model?
- What checks should we perform to ensure a linear model is appropriate?
- How do we interpret slopes in multiple linear regression? How does the interpretation differ from the simple case?
- When we have two predictive variables, one numerical and one categorical, how can we visualize a linear model for each level of the category?
- What are interaction terms and how can we include one in a linear model? 

## Terminology and Skills

- interaction
- `lm()`
- `summary()`
- permutation
- bootstrap
- `confint()`
