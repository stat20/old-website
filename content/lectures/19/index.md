We continue to explore the hypothesis test! As we have seen and will continue to see, the hypothesis test can help us determine whether two variables such as bill depth and species in penguins, are related. Yet, hypothesis tests can also be used to answer other types of questions! We also compare hypothesis tests with confidence intervals. 

### Key Questions

- How do we perform hypothesis tests in practice?
- What is the relationship between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals?
- How can we mold the hypothesis test to help us for problems concerning only one parameter?

### Skills and Terminology

- `infer` library:
- `specify()`
- `hypothesize()`
- `generate()`
- `calculate()`
- `visualize()`
- `shade_pvalue()`
- `get_p_value()`
- point null
- permutation
- taking draws
- Taking draws vs permutations
