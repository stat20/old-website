Whenever you have more than a few observations, it becomes useful to have techniques to summarize the most important characteristics of the data. The two primary classes of tools are numerical summaries (statistics!) and graphics.

### Key Questions

- When you summarize data, how do you decide what to include and what to omit?
- How are various plot types (dot plot, histogram, boxplot) constructed? What do they include? What do they omit?
- How are various measures of a "typical" value (mean, median, mode) constructed? What do they capture and when are they most useful?
- What should you look for when describing the shape of a distribution of data?


### Terminology and Skills
- Plot types: dot plot, histogram, box plot
- Describing the shape of distributions: modality and skew
- Mean, median, mode, max
