Throughout the course, we have thought of population parameters that we want to estimate as being fixed numbers. Maybe they aren't! Therefore, rather than using our data to provide a guess at what the one true value of the parameter might be, let's say that the parameter has a probability distribution-- one that is known to us, but that we can update. This update will be based on our data! 

## Terminology and Skills
