After fitting a simple linear model in the last lecture, we are primed to take some next steps! These steps include using the model for both description and prediction. We will also make sure fitting the model in the first place is appropriate. 

## Key Questions

- What are two common uses of linear models?
- How can we tell if our linear model is performing well?
- When performing residual analysis, what visual cues let us know if our model is appropriate/inappropriate?

## Terminology and Skills

- description
- prediction
- residual analysis
- `lm()`
- `attributes()`
- `coef()`
- `predict()`
- r (the correlation coefficient)
- r^2 (the square of the correlation coefficient)
- interpolation
- extrapolation
- heteroskedasticity
