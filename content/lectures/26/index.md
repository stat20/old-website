So far, we have been thinking of population parameters as fixed numbers. But what if they follow a probability distribution? Then, rather than using our data trying to estimate the one true value of the parameter, we should use our data to help model the probability distributions of our parameters. 
This is the motivation behind Bayesian Estimation!

## Key Question

- What are the prior and the posterior probability distributions and how can we get from the prior to the posterior?

## Terminology

- General multiplication rule
- Bayes' Rule
- Prior distribution
- Posterior distribution
- simulation
