It's always good to study a topic from all different types of angles! To that end, we examine the geometry underpinning multiple regression today. Perhaps the biggest question one might have: what might a prediction "line" look like when we have two predictive variables versus one?

## Key Question

- What does the function yhat look like when we are predicting with:
1. One numerical variable?
2. Two numerical variables?
3. Two numerical variables and one categorical variable?
4. Two numerical variables with an interaction term?

## Terminology and Skills

- plane
