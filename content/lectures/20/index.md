Perhaps the most creative step in the hypothesis test is constructing the null distribution for your observed test statistic! There are many different ways to do this. We have seen some in previous lectures, and today we will compare three. 

## Key Questions

- What are the 'Simulation', 'Exact', and 'Approximate' methods of constructing the null distribution and when can/should each of them be used?
- What does the Central Limit Theorem state?
- How does the Central Limit Theorem help facilitate the 'Approximate Method' of constructing the null distribution?

## Terminology and Skills

- null distribution
- point null
- taking draws
- `infer` library
- `pbinom()`
- Central Limit Theorem
- `pnorm()`
