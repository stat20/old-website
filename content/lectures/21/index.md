Today our exploration of hypothesis testing takes a more theoretical turn. We discuss statistical error rates from a mathematical and graphical lens, discuss how they are / can be influenced and also introduce the notion of power.

## Key Questions

- What are type I and type II error rates?
- What factors affect error rates and in what way? Try to think this through both mathematically and visually.
- How is statistical power important in the context of a hypothesis test?

## Terminology and Skills

- hypothesis test
- null hypothesis
- alternative hypothesis
- Type I and type II error rates
- Statistical power
