We continue to explore the confidence interval, a useful way of estimating the range in which a population parameter might lie! Well, they are useful if their width is sensible, which we discuss! Confidence intervals can be obtained using different methods, such as with probability distributions like the Binomial or with a sampling technique known as bootstrapping. Each method has good reasons to use and we talk about them here.  

### Key Questions

- How does changing the width of our confidence interval affect its helpfulness?
- What are the advantages of using mathematical and computational methods of obtaining a confidence interval, respectively?
- How can we obtain confidence intervals in practice?

### Terminology and Skills

- confidence interval
- sampling variability
- sampling without replacement
- sampling with replacement
- bootstrapping

### Useful Code

- `summarize()`
- `infer` library
- `specify()`
- `calculate()`
- `visualize()`
