You might imagine that a linear model can include many, many predictive variables! Therefore, we need to introduce criterion that can tell us when "enough is enough" when it comes to adding more predictors. 

## Key Question

- What is the major drawback of using R^2 in a linear model with lots of predictive variables and how does adjusted R^2 help rectify it?

## Terminology and Skills

- adjusted R^2
- TSS
- SSR
- signal
- noise
