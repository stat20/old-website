Today we introduce one of the most commonly applicable probability distributions, the Bernoulli distribution. We use our newly found technology of expected value (expectation) and variance to describe a Bernoulli random variable.
We then also introduce the Binomial distribution and show how it is related to the Bernoulli distribution. 

### Key Questions

- What is the Bernoulli probability distribution?
- How can we calculate the probability of multiple events occurring?
- What is the Binomial probability distribution and how does it relate to the Bernoulli distribution?

### Terminology and Skills

- Calculating the expected value and variance of a random variable given its probability distribution
- Conditional probability
- The multiplication rule
