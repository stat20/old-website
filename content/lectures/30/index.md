We have spent the last few lectures making sure that you understand "correlation is not causation," but what exactly is correlation? In answering this question, we also begin our transition from the causal to the prediction portion of the course.

## Key Questions

- How does the correlation coefficient measure the association between two variables? What do different values of the correlation indicate about this association?

- What kinds of data structures/types and graphics allow us to measure and visualize correlation, respectively?

## Terminology and Skills

- causation
- correlation
- correlation coefficient
- scatter plot
