One of the most commonly used test statistics we have studied is the sample mean. There are a lot of choices of inference that can be used with it, but the correct choice depends on your sample size!

## Key Questions

- When it comes to making inference on the sample mean, what methods can/should we use depending on the sample size of our data?

- What are the similarities and differences between Student's t and normal distributions?

## Terminology and Skills

- Student's t distribution
- degrees of freedom
- `qnorm()`
- `qt()`
