We continue to explore the confidence interval, a useful way of estimating the range in which a population parameter might lie! We examine its properties and interpretation. Confidence intervals can be obtained using different methods, such as with probability distributions like the Binomial or with a sampling technique known as bootstrapping. We illustrate both of these procedures. 

### Key Questions

- What information does the confidence interval contain?
- How do we interpret a confidence interval?
- How can we obtain confidence intervals in practice?

### Terminology and Skills

- confidence interval
- sampling variability
- sampling without replacement
- sampling with replacement
- bootstrapping

### Useful Code

- `summarize()`
- `infer` library
- `specify()`
- `generate()`
- `calculate()`
- `get_ci()`
- `visualize()`
- `shade_ci()`
