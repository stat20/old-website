Welcome to the Age of Data, where claims made using data are all around us: in the news, in the pages of scientific journals, in the policies of government, and in the board rooms of companies across the world. In this course you will explore the forms of claims that are made using data. Some of these are subtle claims about the structure of the data at hand. Others are grand claims of scientific truths or predictions of what will happen in the future. This course will train your to critique and begin to construct such arguments made using data.

Selection of topics:

- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Probability and random variable notation
- Study design
- Point and interval estimation
- Hypothesis tests
- Resampling procedures
- Multiple linear regression
- The Bayesian perspective on inference
- Reproducible science


### Course Culture

Students taking Stat 20 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, and GSIs—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.

You will be interacting with course staff and fellow students in several different environments: in lab, in lecture, over the discussion forum, and at the evening study session. Some of these will be in person, some of them will be online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be professional.

If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other students, please come talk to us about it. If you are concerned with issues created by course staff, please talk to the instructor.



### Mode of Instruction

The first two weeks of lectures, labs, evening study session, and office hours will be held live on Zoom. All Zoom links will be distributed via the class forum. After two weeks, we plan to resume the mode of instruction outlined below, though that will be moderated by any changes to campus policy.

Maintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, please do not come to class. Recordings of the lecture are available online and you will have the ability to join a make-up lab remotely.


#### Lectures

This course, Stat 20 in Spring 2022, has three lecture sections. Lecture 002 is a live lecture in-person. Lecture 001 is a simulcast from Lecture 002 projected into an overflow room. The lecture will be recorded and posted to bCourses for asynchronous viewing by all students, including those in Lecture 003, which is a section with only these recorded lectures.

The lecture recordings will be available on bCourses for a window of 24 hours after the lecture was given live. This balances the flexibility to watch lecture when convenient with a structure that will help keep students on up-to-date with the course. All of the lecture recordings will be made available again prior to the midterm and final for review.

If you miss watching the lecture while it is available (say you're very busy with other classwork that day), you are encouraged to read through the slides that will be published to the course website and watch the recording when it becomes available again for review prior to the exams.

#### Labs

Lab sections will be held in person and your attendance is important. It will be difficult to complete all of the lab assignments if you do not attend lab regularly. You must attend the lab for which you are registered.

If you are ill or have been exposed to illness, please do not come to lab and instead join the satellite lab (link available on Ed). This lab is meant only for students who cannot be on campus due to illness.

#### Evening Study Sessions

Evening study session are held twice a week, on Thursday and Monday evening (see Schedule for times and locations). Initially these will be held on Zoom but they will transition to the Student Learning Center once we're able to meet in person.

Please come to evening study session! It's a wonderful way to get assignments done in an environment where you can work with other students and ask questions of tutors are they arise.

#### Office Hours

GSIs and the instructor will offer office hours each week across a range of times. The schedule will be posted to the discussion forum. You're welcome to visit the office hours of any GSI, not only the one who teaches your lab section. We may adjust the office hour schedule throughout the semester as we understand student needs and preferences.

Please come to office hours! Coming to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. On the contrary, coming to office hours early and often tends to co-occur with success in the course.

Feel free to come to Prof. Bray’s office hours even if you don’t have a specific question about an assignment. He is happy to chat about the course material, statistics in general, careers in statistics, or whatever other statistics or data science topics are on your mind!


#### Materials

The textbook associated with this course is [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by &#199;etinkaya-Rundel and Hardin. This is a free online textbook that can also be downloaded as a [pdf](https://leanpub.com/imstat) or ordered in [print](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Statistics-Mine-%C3%87etinkaya-Rundel/dp/1943450145/) for $15.

The following texts are valuable supplementary texts and will be drawn upon for additional readings:

- [Statistics](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393929720), Freedman, Pisani, and Purves
- [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/), Healy
- [Hands-on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/), Grolemund
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), Wickham and Grolemund

The software that we'll be using for our data analysis is the free and open-source language called R that we'll be interacting with via software called RStudio. As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you for at: [http://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu](http://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu). Most students taking Stat 20 have no experience programming; we'll teach you everything you need to know!


### Course communication

#### Discussion forum

Out-of-class communication for this course will be held on [Ed](https://edstem.org). Keep an eye out for an invitation via email in the first week of classes. This forum is a community space to ask and answer questions with your fellow students and course staff. It's an indispensable resource for staying up-to-date with the course and learning from your peers. It's also the primary method of communicating with all of staff by making a new post and flagging it as private.


#### Course website

All of the assignments will be posted to the course website at [https://stat20.org](https://stat20.org). This also holds the course syllabus, extra resources, and staff information.


#### Email

Email should be reserved only for issues of an individual and private matter. Questions about course logistics, policies, and assignment should be posted as a public post to the forum. Questions dedicated to staff generally should be send as a private post in the forum. Only questions of an individual and private nature should go by email to your GSI. In a course this large, the instructor has a difficult time responding to individual emails, so please only email him if this is an issue that cannot be discussed with your GSI or during office hours (but please visit his office hours!).


### Assignments, Exams, and Grading

#### Problem Sets and Labs

There are two main assignment types in this class.

The **problem set** is meant as practice: practice with the concepts and methods from lecture that you'll need to hone in order to do the labs well and succeed on the quizzes. Since the goal of these is just practice, they will be graded credit / no credit, where credit is an earnest attempt (evidence that you worked on most of the problems).

The **lab** is meant to apply the concepts from lecture in the cause of doing an analysis of real data. This will involve both writing code and communicating your thoughts and findings in English.

There will be one problem set and one lab each week. You will be turning in your assignments on a platform called  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). This is also the platform where your assignments will be graded, so you can return there to get feedback on your work. You are also welcome to file a regrade request if you notice that we made an error in applying the rubric to your work.

#### Quizzes

Roughly every two weeks there will be a short online quiz to assess your understanding of the material covered in lecture and lab those two weeks. You will have 25 minutes to take the quiz sometime within a 24 hour window. If you're unsatisfied with your performance because you didn't understand something, didn't have the time to study, or slept throught, a second quiz with different questions will open a few days after the first testing the same content but with different questions. We will take as your grade which ever of the two scores is higher.

#### Exams

There will be one midterm and one final, each held in person. The final will be held in the time slot on the official [UC Berkeley Exam Schedule](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/scheduling/academic-scheduling/academic-scheduling-final-exam-guide-and-schedules/).

#### Grading

Your final grade in the course will be computed based on:

- Labs 35%
- Quizzes 14%
- Problem sets 1%
- Midterm 20%
- Final 30%

The goal of your course staff is to help you develop and demonstrate your mastery of the material. As such, the course will not be curved. Additionally, your weakest lab and problem set will be dropped before calculating your grade for the course.


### Policies

#### Accomodations for students with disabilities

Stat 20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements. For students with extended time on timed assessments, the time period you have to take the online quiz will be automatically extended accordingly. Such students will take the midterm and final through the campus proctoring service, which will provide extended time.


#### Late Work

Unfortunately, with a class of this size, we are unable to keep track of and grade late submissions of labs and problem sets, so they will not be accepted. To make up for this inflexibility, we have pushed back each lab and problem set due date so that you will have four days, spanning two evening study sessions, to complete them. Please submit your work to Gradescope well before the deadline. You can resubmit it as many times as you like up until the deadline, so you can always go back and change things, but at least you'll have something submitted if you lose wifi right before the deadline.


### Collaboration policy

You are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem sets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. Quizzes and exams must reflect only your work.

Researchers don't use one another's research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer's permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (quizzes, exams, lecture recordings-any private class materials) from their classes without the written permission of the instructor. Lecture recordings must also not be posted publicly because that violates laws protecting the privacy of students featured in the lecture.

The general rule: you must not submit assignments that reflect the work of others unless they are a cited collaborator.

The following examples of collaboration **are** allowed and in fact encouraged!

- Discussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.
- Showing your code to a classmate along with an error message or confusing output.
- Posting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking help.
- Helping other students solve questions on the discussion with conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn't whole hog give away the answer.
- Googling the text of an error message.
- Copying small snippets of code from answers on Stack Overflow.

The following examples are **not** allowed:

- Leaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot) where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this include websites like course hero, on a group text chain, over discord/slack, or in a file passed on to future students.
- Accessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other students distributed as above.
- Googling for complete problem solutions.
- Working on the quizzes in collaboration with other people or resources. Quizzes must reflect individual work.
- Submitting work on an exam that reflects consultation with outside resources or other people. Exams must reflect individual work.

If you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask. There is never a penalty for asking! We’re always happy to clarify.

#### Please Don’t Cheat

We’re sorry this section of the syllabus is so sad. We don’t like it either. But it’s upsetting to students if other students are cheating, so we use TurnItIn to detect cheating on labs and have access to data through Gradescope to detect cheating on quizzes.

Students determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii) Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.

And again, if you have questions about the boundaries of the collaboration policy, please ask!


### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What do I do if I start the course late?

If you join the course late, we heartily encourage you to look through past lecture slides and do previous assignments, even if the due dates have since passed and they can no longer be submitted. Reading through the posts on the discussion forum is a good place to start. Please also visit your GSIs office hours to introduce yourself.

In a class of this size, we are unfortunately not able to grade late work. Your score from your lowest problem set and lab will be dropped before calculating your grade, which provides a buffer. Also, the first problem set and lab are credit / no credit and will be counted regardless of when they are submitted.
