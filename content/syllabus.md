**Instructor**: Jeremy Sanchez

GSI: TBD

<span style="color:blue"> The Fall 2022 course is **completely different
in structure from this Summer Sessions course.** </span>
<span style="color:blue"> For information about that course, please
</span> [click
here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgHI8VloHpOMoAHkgmqjub7364neb8At74OOsccgI3c/edit?usp=sharing).

I (Jeremy) and the GSI (TBD) are very excited to have you guys this
semester. We (Jeremy and TBD) recognize this is a course primarily
intended as a prerequisite for business and economics majors, so we are
excited to learn from you as well. Our goal is to give you a first
foundation in statistics that you can use throughout your careers.

The goal of this course is to construct and critique claims made using
data. The types of claim we will be discussing are: descriptive,
generalizations, causal, and predictive.

The course is structured by week. Each week will focus on a particular
subject, and all the material and assignments for that subject will be
due at the end of the "course week," which begins on **Monday at
12:00am** and ends **every Sunday at 11:59pm**. This way, you guys will
not have assignments due regarding one topic and yet have to go to
lecture and labs where we talk about another.

Here is a list of the main course topics, separated by week and with
type of statistical claim in parentheses

-   Week 1: Introduction, types of data, and reproducible research
-   Week 2: Descriptive Statistics (Descriptive)
-   Week 3: Confidence Intervals (Generalizations)
-   Week 4: Review  
-   Week 5: Hypothesis Tests (Generalizations)
-   Week 6: Experimental Design (Causal)
-   Week 7: Linear regression (Predictive)
-   Week 8: Review & Wrap Up, Special Topics

En route to learning these topics, we'll also discuss:

-   Probability and random variable notation
-   Resampling procedures

And all of these will be explored traditionally and by coding methods (R
and RStudio)!

### Culture

Students taking Stat 20 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope
to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on
curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community
are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.

You will be interacting with us (Jeremy and TBD) and fellow students in
several different environments. Some of these will be in person, some
online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be
professional.

If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other
students, please come talk to us about it. If you are concerned with
issues created by myself or the GSI, please speak with me (Jeremy).

*See Miscellaneous - On Confidentiality and Miscellaneous - Campus
Resources*.

### Mode of Instruction

(Primarily) in-person. This is subject to change with fluctuations in
the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Lecture

I will meet you guys in Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at
11:30am in Hearst Memorial Mining Building, Room 390.

The lectures will be recorded and available on *bCourses* **until the
end of the course week, Sunday, 11:59pm**.

However, because I understand you will want to prepare the best you can
for the exams, all of the lecture recordings will be made available to
you again **one week prior to the midterm and final**.

If you miss the lectures in-person or online, go ahead and read over the
slides and ask questions on the class forum. This should allow you to
catch up!

***There is no lecture on Monday, July 4***. Happy Independence Day!

### Labs

Lab sections will be held by the GSI in Evans Hall 432 on Monday,
Wednesday, and Thursday. There are three sections: Section 1, Section 2,
and Section 3, held at 1:00p, 2:00p, and 3:00p, respectively.

These sections are meant to help you complete the (mostly) weekly lab
assignments and serve as review periods on test weeks, so please do
attend! This is also a great opportunity to meet and collaborate with
your classmates.

If you are ill or have been exposed to illness (including and not
limited to COVID-19), please do not come to lab and instead join the
satellite lab I will be hosting. The link to sign up will be available
on the class forum. This lab is a two hour section and is meant only for
students who cannot be on campus due to illness. It's a condensed
version of the three sections you would normally attend. Weekly time and
date TBA.

### Office Hours

I and the GSI will host office hours each week.

The preferred times will be chosen by you all and we will balance these
with our personal schedules to select the times. The final times will be
placed here once they have been chosen. We may adjust the office hour
schedule throughout the semester as we understand student needs and
preferences.

Coming to office hours is not only for people that are behind or need
extra help. Even if you are interested in talking about statistics and
data science in general, we'd love to chat with you.

### Materials

There are no outright required materials for this course. However, we
will be drawing from some materials so you should be aware of them.

The primary textbook associated with this course is [Introduction to
Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by
Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Hardin. This is a free online textbook that can
also be downloaded as a [pdf](https://leanpub.com/imstat) or ordered in
[print](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Statistics-Mine-%C3%87etinkaya-Rundel/dp/1943450145/)
for \$15.

The following texts are valuable supplementary texts and will be drawn
upon for additional readings:

-   [Statistics](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393929720), Freedman,
    Pisani, and Purves
-   [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/),
    Healy
-   [Hands-on Programming with
    R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/), Grolemund
-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), Wickham and Grolemund

### Programming

Learning some form of computer programming is essential for modern
statistics and data analysis. If you are not familiar with any
programming, that's ok. Most students taking Stat 20 are in your shoes
and we'll teach you everything you need to know!

The software that we'll be using is the free and open-source language
called *R* that we'll be interacting with via software called *RStudio*.
As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you
for at: <http://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu>.

### Course communication

#### Discussion forum

The class forum will be held on [Ed](https://edstem.org). Keep an eye
out for an e-mail invite in the first week of classes.

We have this forum so you can ask and answer questions with your fellow
students and course staff. It's really useful for staying up-to-date
with the course and learning from your classmates.

We'd also prefer that you communicate with us on *Ed*. How you can do
that is by making a new post and flagging it as private.

#### Course website

All of the assignments will be posted on this website
<https://stat20.org>. The webiste also holds the course syllabus, extra
resources, and staff information.

#### Email

If you have a question about the course logistics and content, go ahead
and post it without the private setting to the class forum.

We'd love for you to e-mail us regarding issues of an individual and
private matter, if you're not comfortable with using the private setting
on *Ed*.

### Assignments, Exams, and Grading

#### Problem Sets and Labs

There are two main assignment types in this class. They will be released
together (mostly) **every Monday**.

The **problem set** is meant as practice: practice with the concepts and
methods from lecture that you'll need to hone in order to do the labs
well and succeed on the quizzes. Since the goal of these is just
practice, they will be graded credit / no credit. You'll get full credit
if we see that you worked on most of the problems. There will be six
problem sets.

The **lab** is meant to apply the concepts from lecture in the cause of
doing an analysis of real data. This will involve both writing code and
regularly. There will be six labs.

You will be turning in the assignments on a platform called
[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). Gradescope is really awesome
and you can return there to get feedback on your work or to file a
regrade request if you you notice that we made an error in applying the
rubric to your work.

Both assignments will be due on Gradescope **at the end of the course
week, Sunday, 11:59pm**.

##### Late Work

As another part of trying to lasso each section of the course into its
week, late work will not be accepted. However, I and the GSI both
recognize there are things going on in each of your lives which you
might need to handle throughout the course.

Because of this, when it comes to labs, we're going to give you **one
drop** and **one two-day extension (until the following Tuesday,
11:59pm)**, no questions asked. Here are some rules:

1.  These will be used separately, one per lab. For example, you can
    drop Lab 1 and extend Lab 3.
2.  You must use the drop before the extension.
3.  You must notify me of your wish to use the lab drop / extension by
    **the due date of the lab (Sunday, 11:59pm)**.

When it comes to the problem sets, we're going to **drop the lowest
score**. No contact necessary.

#### Quizzes

As a precursor to the midterm and final, we will have two remote
quizzes, released on **Friday, July 8** and **Friday, August 5**,
respectively.

You will have 25 minutes to take the quiz sometime between 12:00am and
11:59p though make sure you start by at least 11:34p!

This is an individual assignment, so please don't collaborate with
others.

#### Tests

The midterm will be held on **Thursday, July 14** at the normal class
time and location.

The final will be held on **Wednesday, August 10**, also at the normal
class time and location. It will primarily focus on the material covered
after the midterm.

You can have one two-sided cheatsheet for the midterm, and two for the
final. Just make sure they are only comprised of your handwriting. You
don't have to turn them in after the test.

There will be a clobber policy. What this means is that you can replace
your midterm score with your final score if you want to. Our plan is to
release midterm grades by **Sunday, July 17**. Once the grades are
released, if you want to use the clobber policy, e-mail me by **Sunday,
July 24**.

#### Grading

Your final grade in the course will be computed based on:

-   Labs 49%
-   Problem sets 1%
-   Quiz 1 5%
-   Quiz 2 5%
-   Midterm 20%
-   Final 20%

I made the labs the majority of the grade because the main takeaway of
the class should be your ability to do data analysis in a semi-formal
setting.

There is no curve, so you don't need to worry about this.

#### Collaboration policy

You are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem
sets and labs, but the labs you turn in should reflect your own
understanding and **all of your collaborators must be cited**. Go ahead
and write this sentence before the first question on your lab. Also,
your quiz and test submission must reflect only your work.

Students may not circulate or post non-public materials (tests, quizzes,
lecture recordings-any private class materials) from the class without
the written permission of the instructor. Lecture recordings must also
not be posted publicly because that violates laws protecting the privacy
of students featured in the lecture.

We all need help sometimes. In fact, some forms of help, like googling
the text of an error message, are almost necessary for you to learn
self-reliance when it comes to the coding portion of the course. In that
vein:

the following examples of collaboration **are** allowed and in fact
encouraged!

-   Discussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.
-   Showing your code to a classmate along with an error message or
    confusing output.
-   Posting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking
    help.
-   Helping other students solve questions on the discussion with
    conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn't give away the
    entire answer.
-   Googling the text of an error message.
-   Copying small snippets of code from answers on *Stack Overflow*,
    **with proper citation**.

The following examples **are not** allowed:

-   Leaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot)
    where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this
    include websites like *Course Hero*, on a group chat, over
    *Discord/Slack*, or in a file passed on to future students.
-   Accessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other
    students distributed as above.
-   googling for complete problem solutions.
-   Submitting work on an exam or a quiz that indicates you used the
    work of outside resources or other people.

If you have questions about the boundaries of our policy, please ask us;
there is no penalty for doing this.

#### More on Cheating

To check for cheating, we use *Turnitin* for labs and have access to
data through *Gradescope* to detect cheating on quizzes.

Students determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by
the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the
course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First
violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii)
Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational
interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.

If you have questions about the boundaries of our policy, please ask us;
there is no penalty for doing this.

#### What do I do if I start the course late?

If you join the course late, we encourage you to look through past
lecture slides and do the previous assignments as best as you can, even
if the due dates have since passed and they can no longer be submitted.
Reading through the posts on the discussion forum is a good place to
start. We'd also love to meet your during office hours.

### Miscellaneous (Please Read)

#### Accommodations for students with disabilities

We want all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations
from the Disabled Students' Program, please share them with your
instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary
arrangements. For students with extended time on timed assessments, the
time period you have to take the online quiz will be automatically
extended accordingly. Such students will take the midterm and final
through the campus proctoring service, which will provide extended time.

#### On Confidentiality

If you wish to talk to us about incidents of sexual violence, sexual
harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy, we are
here for you. However, please know that:

*As UC employees, I and the GSI are "Responsible Employees" and are
therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual
harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the
Title IX officer. We cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual
violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests
for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources
available to you through UCB's PATH to Care Center, which serves
survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care
Line at 510-643-2005.*
