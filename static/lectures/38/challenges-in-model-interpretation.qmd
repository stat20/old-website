What is the relationship between `bed` and `logprice`?

. . .

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
LA %>%
  filter(bed > 0, bed < 7) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bed, y = logprice)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .5) +

```


## {}

What is the relationship between `logsqft` and `logprice`?

. . .

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
LA %>%
  filter(bed > 0, bed < 7) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = logsqft, y = logprice)) +

## {}

What is the relationship between `logsqft` and `logprice`, controlling for `bed`?

. . .

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
LA %>%
  filter(bed < 7, bed > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = logsqft, y = logprice)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  facet_wrap(vars(bed)) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18)
```


## {}

What is the relationship between `bed` and `logprice`, controlling for `logsqft`?

. . .

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
LA %>%
  filter(bed < 7, bed > 0) %>%
  mutate(logsqft_cat = cut(logsqft, breaks = 6)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bed, y = logprice)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .3) +
  facet_wrap(vars(logsqft_cat)) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18)
```


## Simpson's Paradox

Simpson's paradox, which also goes by several other names, is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.

# What is a *model*?

[A specific answer to a specific question.]{.bigadage}

[A prediction machine.]{.bigadage}


## Model Interpretation

**Question 1**
What is the relationship between the number of bedrooms in a house and its price?

. . .

$$ \widehat{\textrm{log(price)}} = 11.8 + .53 \textrm{bed}$$

. . .

**Question 2**
After controlling for the size of a house, what is the relationship between the number of bedrooms in a house and its price?

$$ \widehat{\textrm{log(price)}} = 11.8 + -0.12 \textrm{bed} + 1.66 \textrm{log(sqft)}$$

UC Berkeley Gender Bias in Admissions


## UC Berkeley Admissions (1973)

Admission rate to the graduate school was 44% for men and 35% for women.

. . .

```{r fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.height="400", out.width="750"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ucb-1.png")
```

# Ecological Fallacy

## Immigration and Illiteracy

<br>
<br>

[How does the literacy rate compare between native-born and foreign born US residents in 1930?]{.smalladage}

. . .

<br>

> **Robinson's data**: percent foreign born and percent illiterate in each of the 9 geographic divisions of the US.


## Immigration and Illiteracy

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/eco-robinson.png")
```

. . .

> Suggests foreign-born people tend to be more literate (cor = -0.51).

[Source: Robinson, 1950]{.footnote}


## Immigration and Illiteracy

Let's look instead at *individual-level* data.

. . .

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
birthplace <- rep(c("foreign", "native"), each = 100)
literate <- as.factor(c(rep(c("yes", "no"), c(90, 10)), rep(c("yes", "no"), c(96, 4))))
literate <-  factor(literate, levels(literate)[c(2,1)])
df <- data.frame(birthplace, literate)
ggplot(df, aes(x = birthplace, fill = literate)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```


## What's going on?

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/eco-robinson.png")
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Unit of observation**: region (New England, Mountain, Pacific, etc.)

<br>

- **Explanation**: regions with many foreign-born have highly literate natives.

## Ecological Fallacy

The false assumption that relationships that exist at an **aggregated level** (e.g. between states, counties, nations) also hold at the **individual level**.

## Strategies

1. When dealing with an ecological study, restrict model interpretations to the 
same observational level on which the data was collected.
2. If you want to make individual-level inferences, be sure your data is collected on that same level. Aggregate-level effects can be introduced via a multi-level model (take more stats!)
